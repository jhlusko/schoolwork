Note about testing:
Tests are strangely separated into different files because if they are put into the same file the global variable player_lists either grows with each subsequent testcase, or if torn down refuses to be re-added to. I posted about this problem on Piazza (http://piazza.com/class#winter2012/csc148h/444). Separating the files allows each of my testcases to work, and not interfere with each other.
