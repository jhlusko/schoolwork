Data structure descriptions:

Nurse class:
Nurse objects store a log-in ID string.

Patient List class:
Patient list is a list of Patient objects stored in two different Map<object, Patient>:
patients, a Map<String, Patient> that contains all patients at that ER, with Health Card Numbers as 
keys to retrieve patient records.
doctorQueueByArrival Map<Time, Patient> that contains patients not yet seen by a doctor, with
admission Date as keys to retrieve patient records.

Patient class:
Patient objects store name and health card number as Strings and the patient's date of birth as 
a Date object, hospital arrival time is stored as a Date object (number of millisecs since January 1, 1970).
Patient objects store doctor visits, as a list of Date objects, one for each time the patient was seen 
by a doctor.
Patient keeps track of whether the patient needs to see a doctor, stored as a Boolean.
Patient keeps a Map<Date, Vitals>, storing the vital signs, with the associated timeTaken as key for
retrieving/storing/sorting.
Patient stores symptom descriptions as a Map<Date, String>.

Vitals class:
Each Vitals object stores temperature, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate 
stored as ints.


File system description
The patient list is stored in a single text file. Each line stores a Patient Object. 
Patients are re-created as file is read. Each member variable of each Patient object is separated by a 
special character and within member variables, further delineation is made by different special characters, as follows:
Patient member variables are stored in the following order, separated by @: 
name @ date of birth (in MM/dd/yyyy format) @ Health Card Number @ 
arrival time (in MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss format) @ doctorVisits @ vitals @ symptoms

For doctorVisits List<Date>, the times of different doctor visits are stored in the default List string 
representation
For vitals Map<Date, Vitals>, the Date/Vitals pairs are separated by $ and Date is separated from Vitals 
by ^ and is stored in MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss format
Within Vitals objects, the 4 member variables are separated by % (i.e. temperature % SystolicBP % 
DiastolicBP % HeartRate)
For symptoms Map<Date, String>, the Date/String pairs are separated by $ and Date is separated from 
String by ^ and is stored in MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss format
